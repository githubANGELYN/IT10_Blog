        <li><b>Revolving credit</b> is a loan allows you to continuously borrow money against <span style="color: rgb(0, 140, 255);"> a line of credit</span> and pay it back with monthly payments.</li><br>
        <li><b>Open credit</b> also allows you to continuously borrow money, but there are no interest rates and you're required to pay your balance in full each month to avoid penalties.</li><br>
    </ul>
